# AutonomosTurtlebot



You can use this code to generate a new map for Dijktra and A* so you could make the turtlebot go the best way possible to the goal. First you need to generate the coordinats by going on the terminal: "python3 a_start2.py" and it will generate coordinates on the x_y.txt after that you will have to got to call the "robot_control.py" but this one you have to call with python2 as turtlebot2i does not support python3.
The same thing you can do with Dijkstra, also you have other scripts you may use to go to a specific point on map or just go to a position and pose, also the part with robot_control.py has AI detection in which uses 5 different classes with MLP algorithms, you can add other classes if you want but you have to train the model from the beggining.

The same scripts you can use it on gazebo simulator.
